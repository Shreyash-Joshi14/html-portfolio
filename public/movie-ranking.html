<h1>THE BEST MOVIE CRITIC OF ALL TIME</h1>
<h2>-Shreyash Joshi</h2>
<h2>My recommended movies of all time</h2>
<hr/><hr/>
<h3>PROJECT ALMANIAC</h3>
<p>The most underrated time traveller movie of all time in which a teenage kid finds a blueprint of a time machine from his lated father's materials.With his friends he makes a time machine by using the blueprint.Due to the use of the time machine there is a ripple effect in the time of all different timelines."Will not tell you much as it will spoil the movie for you."</p>
<h3>JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4</h3>
<p>The best is the fighting scenes with not a great ending but the plot of the movie and the direction is just awsome. As you know the coolness of Mr. Wick from previous parts it is much  better in this part.But the competiter of him named _____(you will find out) is a bit overated as even being blind he gives a tough competition to our Mr. Wick which is not acceptable.</p>
<h3>TAKEN</h3>
<p>The best detective,agent movie which is the most underrated castind LIAM NESSON.Everything about the movie is just awsome.I would personally recommend you to not see anything about the movie just watch it.</p>
<h3>PREDESTINATION</h3>
<p>Also a good time travelling concept movie with a different concept from the PROJECT ALMANIAC but is also too underrated.!!MUST WATCH !!</p>
<h3>YOUR NAME</h3>
<p>Oh my!!!! what should i say about this anime masterpiece movie which is also based on the concept of time travelling but only for a certian boundary.Just watch the movie and you will be mesmerised by it.You'll never foget this movie.</p>
